# Traction-control-locker
Arduino-based traction control system using CAN Bus and PID algorithm

## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based traction control system that mimics a locking differential using wheel speed sensors with button-controlled brake actuation.

## Features
- Real-time wheel slip detection using CAN Bus.
- PID-based brake modulation to balance torque.
- Cost-effective alternative to LSD or mechanical lockers.

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno
- CAN Bus Module
- Wheel Speed Sensors
- Brake Actuator
